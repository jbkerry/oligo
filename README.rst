``oligo`` provides functionality to automate oligo (bait) design for DNA capture experiments, providing the user with details about capture efficiency of the sequences generated.

.. highlights:: 
  Since version 0.2, oligo provides a more efficient installation process and provides the user with the option of running the tool via a Docker image. This version is still
  in a pre-release beta phase. For the older format of oligo, please use version 0.1.2. Documentation specific for v0.1.2 can be found here https://oligo.readthedocs.io/en/0.1.2/.

Installation
============
Local
-----
oligo
^^^^^
To install ``oligo`` on your local machine, it is recommended to first create a new Python environment ( >=3.8 ) using your preferred method e.g. ``conda``, ``pyenv`` etc. Once the new environment is activated, install ``oligo``
via ``pip``. Note that the package is called ``oligo`` but has a published name of ``oligo-capture`` to ensure it had a unique name in the public repository. 

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install oligo-capture

Ensure it has installed correctly by running the following command and verifying that you see the installed version in the standard output

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python -m oligo --version
  oligo v0.2

Before running the full ``oligo`` pipeline you will need to install RepeatMasker and either BLAT or STAR, depending on how you intend to run ``oligo`` (see below for more details)

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. highlights:: 

  Since running oligo locally requires a number of third-party software to be installed, users might find it less hassle to run ``oligo``
  via the Docker image, if this option is available to them. See the Docker_ section for more details.

*RepeatMasker*
  ``oligo`` uses RepeatMasker (RM) to determine if oligos contain simple sequence repeats as these can reduce the efficiency of the oligo for targeted capture. Follow the instructions
  on `RepeatMasker home page <http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatMasker/>`_ for installing RM on your local system. The most recent version of RM that ``oligo`` has been tested with is v4.1.5. As detailed
  on the RM home page, its installation depends on a Sequence Search Engine (it is recommended to use **HMMER** for ``oligo``) and Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF). For the Repeat Database, RM ships
  with the curated set of Dfam 3.7 Transposable Elements which is sufficient but users are free to use the full set if required; further instructions are on the RM home page.

.. highlights::

  The RM home page mentions that it requires the Python library ``h5py``, however this is listed as a dependency of the ``oligo`` package so will already be installed in your Python environment
  from when you ran the ``pip install`` step.

*BLAT*
  ``oligo`` uses the BLAST-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) to determine any off-target binding sites of an oligo within the genome, in addition to its intended binding site. An oligo that binds
  to multiple regions will have a reduced score since it will perform a less-specific capture. `BLAT <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html>`_ executables can be found by going to
  `<http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/>`_ and locating the BLAT directory in the for your systems archtecture. For example, for Linux.x86 architecture, ``rsync`` should be used
  to get the BLAT executables on your system:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rsync -aP rsync://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/genome/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/blat/ ./

See `<http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/blat/>`_ for more details.

.. highlights::

  Please note, that as specified on its website, "the Blat source and executables are freely available for academic, nonprofit and personal use. Commercial licensing information is
  available on the Kent Informatics website (http://www.kentinformatics.com/)". Ensure that you are adhering to this licence agreement if you are using ``oligo`` with ``--blat`` enabled.

*STAR*
  As an alternative to BLAT, ``oligo`` allows users to use the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) alignment program for increased speed when determining multiple binding
  events for oligo sequences. BLAT is more widely used to detect off-target binding events, however BLAT can be particulary slow for large designs, especially for the human
  reference genomes. STARâ€™s exceptional speed is better suited for designs with >1000 oligos. If you think you would prefer to use STAR instead, visit the
  `STAR GitHub page <https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR>`_ for instructions on how to install it.

Docker
------

Due to ``oligo`` requiring various third-party software, it can instead be run from a pre-built Docker image that has everything needed already installed. This should make the setup much
easier for users as well as reducing the need to install lots of software on their local machines. Running via Docker is obviously less flexible in terms of the configuration of the
third-party software but has been built with the most common use cases in mind and reducing the image size to as small as possible, without losing any of requirements ``oligo`` uses from
the third-party software. **Currently the Docker image only supports running oligo with BLAT, not STAR.**

First pull the latest oligo image onto your local machine:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker pull jbkerry/oligo:latest

You can also specify a version if needed. The Docker image versions match the oligo package version i.e., jbkerry/oligo:0.2 will be running ``oligo`` v0.2:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker pull jbkerry/oligo:0.2

The docker entrypoint is set to run ``oligo`` with the config file already set up to point to the install executables of BLAT and RepeatMasker so users can run the image, starting with
the ``oligo`` subcommand that is required (see the Usage_ section for more details).

In order for your BED file and reference genome FASTA files to be accessible to the Docker container, your local directories with these files must be mounted into the Docker container
using the ``-v`` option when you call the ``docker run`` command on the image. The Docker image runs the ``oligo`` command from a top-level directory called ``/results`` and stores
all of its output files here. In order to see them on your local machine after the run has finished, you will need to mount a local directory where you want to store the results, to
this ``/results`` directory. Again, this mount with the ``-v`` option needs to be done at the image runtime.

For example, running the ``oligo`` command with the ``off-target`` subcommand might look something like this with the Docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker run -v /local/path/oligo_results:/results -v /local/human:/genome jbkerry/oligo:latest off-target -f /genome/genome.fa -g hg38 -b ./off_target_sites.bed -o 100 -t 50 -m 300 --blat

With this command, the output results will appear in the example local directory of ``/local/path/oligo_results``. Note that this example command is using the Linux filepath
format (i.e., ``/.../``) for the local directories. On Windows (not using WSL) the mounting would look like this:

.. code-block::

  $ docker run -v C:\local\path\oligo_results:/results -v C:\local\human:/genome jbkerry/oligo:latest off-target -f /genome/genome.fa -g hg38 -b ./off_target_sites.bed -o 100 -t 50 -m 300 --blat

Because the docker image is built on top of a Debian Linux image, the paths that local directories get mounted to in the container (i.e. the right-hand side of the ``:`` for 
the ``-v`` options) still need to use the Linux filepath format, even when running from a Windows machine.

Installation specifics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Below is a list of the versions and alterations that have been made to the standard installs of third-party software for the ``oligo`` Docker image:
  * RepeatMasker v4.1.5
  
    * Dfam.h5 library has been replaced with an HMM matrices containing only mouse- and human-specific transposable elements in order to reduce the size of the Docker image
  * HMMER v3.3.2
  * Tandem Repeat Finder v4.09.1
  * BLAT v37.x1
  
The HMM matrices were generated with the following two commands, run from with the top-level RepeatMasker directory (``famdb.py`` comes bundled with the latest versions of RepeatMasker):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./famdb.py -i Libraries/RepeatMaskerLib.h5 families --format hmm 'Homo sapiens' --include-class-in-name >humans.hmm
  $ ./famdb.py -i Libraries/RepeatMaskerLib.h5 families --format hmm 'Mus musculus' --include-class-in-name >mouse.hmm

The Dockerfile in the ``oligo`` GitHub repository can be referenced for details of the how the Docker image was built. Some reference data files that get copied into the image at build
time are not present in the repository but can be provided to the user if needed.

Usage
=====

``oligo`` can be run with one of three subcommands

* `capture <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/capture.html>`_: designs oligos for a standard Capture-C experiment. The user supplies a list of viewpoint coordinates, and oligos are generated adjacent to the flanking recognition sequence of a specified restriction enzyme.
* `tiled <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/tiled.html>`_: designs oligos for multiple adjacent restriction fragments across a specified region of a chromosome, or for the entire chromosome. If ``tiled`` is run in contiguous mode, oligos are generated independent of restriction fragments and
  are instead generated for a user-specified step size, in an adjacent manner.
* `off-target <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/off_target.html>`_: designs oligos to capture DNA surrounding potential CRISPR off-target cut sites to allow for efficient sequencing to determine off-target activity.

These subcommands all generate oligo sequences, based on different underlying behaviours. Methods from the `Tools <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/tools_class.html>`_ class in the ``oligo.tools`` module are then used to check
the off-target binding and repeat content of the oligos. This information is output in a file called *oligo_info.txt*; oligo sequences are written to a FASTA file called *oligo_seqs.fa*

**Example**

The subcommand follows the ``oligo`` command and options for the subcommand are then specified afterwards. Note that the config text file, specifying paths to the installed RepeatMasker,
BLAT and STAR directories (see `Dependencies`_) must be specified between ``oligo`` and the chosen subcommand, with the ``-cfg`` argument. An example config file can be viewed
`here <https://github.com/jbkerry/oligo/blob/main/config.txt>`_. Below, is an example using the ``off-target`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python -m oligo -cfg ./config.txt off-target -f /path/to/human/genome.fa -g hg38 -b ./off_target_sites.bed -o 100 -t 50 -m 300 --blat 

**Command-line help**

The ``oligo`` options and subcommands can be viewed with the ``--help`` flag from the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python -m oligo --help
    Usage: python -m oligo [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      --version
      -cfg, --config PATH  [required]
      --help               Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      capture
      off-target
      tiled

For options specific to each subcommand, run ``oligo`` with the desired subcommand, followed by ``--help``. Note that you will need to provide the ``-cfg`` flag for this to work:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python -m oligo -cfg ./config.txt off-target --help
    Usage: python -m oligo off-target [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -f, --fasta PATH                Path to reference genome fasta.  [required]
      (etc.)

For full documentation on each of the subcommands and how each of their options affects the run, see the full documentation at http://oligo.readthedocs.io. There you will find
a detailed documentation page for each of the subcommands, as well as information regarding the oligo output file and how best to make use of it.
