Capture Oligo Design
====================

The *design.py* module consists of three classes for Capture-C oligo design.

* `Capture <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/capture.html>`_: designs oligos for a standard Capture-C experiment. The user supplies a list of viewpoint coordinates, and oligos are generated adjacent to the flanking recognition sequence of a specified restriction enzyme.
* `Tiled <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/tiled.html>`_: designs oligos for multiple adjacent restriction fragments across a specified region of a chromosome, or for the entire chromosome. If *Tiled* is run in contiguous mode, oligos are generated independent of restriction fragments and
  are instead generated for a user-specified step size, in an adjacent manner.
* `OffTarget <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/off_target.html>`_: designs oligos to capture DNA surrounding potential CRISPR off-target cut sites to allow for efficient sequencing to determine off-target activity.

These three classes all generate oligo sequences, based on different underlying behaviours. When run from the command line, *design.py* uses methods from the `Tools <http://oligo.rtfd.io/en/latest/tools_class.html>`_ class in the *tools.py* module, in a pipeline that checks
the off-target binding and repeat content of the oligos. This information is output in a file called *oligo_info.txt*; oligo sequences are written to a FASTA file called *oligo_seqs.fa*
